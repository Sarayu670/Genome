# Genomic Interaction Classification Flowchart

The flowchart shows the genomic data processing pipeline in four main sections:

1. **Data Loading & Preprocessing**
   - Load files → Check data → Handle missing values → Remove duplicates → Format data
   - Input: Raw genomic data

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Analyze features → Create new features → Calculate ratios → Transform → Validate
   - Includes feedback loop to data loading

3. **Model Development**
   - Select algorithm → Tune parameters → Cross-validate → Train model

4. **Output Results**
   - Generate predictions → Create visualizations → Export reports

Bottom labels:
- "Data Balancing" (first two sections)
- "Web" (last two sections)

All sections are connected with arrows showing the data flow direction.
